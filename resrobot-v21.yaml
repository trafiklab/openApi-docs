      - Station lookup
      summary: 'Use this method to search for stations and stops based on a name.'
      description: 'Use this method to search for stations and stops based on a name. You can search for stations for both departures and arrival of a call. The stations found can then be presented to a user so that they can choose exactly which station they want to travel to or from. This method is not designed to be used for auto-complete solutions where a search is done while the user enters the name of a station. If you wish to use autocomplete, or if you want to provide your users with **the best experience**, please use the **GTFS Sverige 2 stops.txt** file as an offline database.
        <h3>Order of the results</h3>
        <p>The results are ordered by station “weight”, where stations with more weight are shown higher in the list. Each station or stop is assigned a weight value which indicates how “busy” this station is. The higher the value, the more “busy” the station is. The calculation is based on the product classes. For each product class operating at this stop, the frequency how often this product class operates is rated between 0 and 3 where 0 means this product isn’t operating and 3 means that this product operates at a high frequency. Then an individual weight is calculated for product class by multiplying the frequency rating with a certain factor. These factors take into account that traffic by trains for example weighs higher than traffic by buses. The weight for the station is then the sum over all individual weights for each product class.</p>'

      - name: input
        in: query
        description: "The name, or a part of the name, of the station that should be looked up. <p>By default, the system will search for results with a 100% match between the search string and results. For example, when searching for 'stock' it will only return results which contain 'stock' somewhere in their name. However, in many cases it may be of interest to see the other results which may not represent a 100% match but are still quite close. To enable this output, add a question mark “?” at the end of the input string. Then the service will also return the other, non-100% matching results up to the specified maximum number of results. For example, 'Mälarsjukhus?' will also return 'Mälarparksvägen' because of the partial match, but would not be included without the question mark in the query.
